# iCEx-os
This is a little project I've been putting together for the purpose of learning how to write a simple operating system. This code is meant to run using `bochs` on MacOS and compiled with `nasm`.

I'm leaving this repository public, since this is not used for anything so, use at your own risk, I cannot be held responsible for any damage this code can cause to your equipment.

Enjoy!
